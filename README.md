# RustyFabric Gradle Plugin
This is a Gradle Plugin that allows the user to develop and execute Fabric modifications with the Rust and Java programming languages with the WebAssembly runtime [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio). **This is a highly experimental project and not ready for production usage but I try to do my best.**

## Usage in Java and Rust
At the moment, the Gradle plugin is too underdeveloped to use it in an environment. The instructions for the usage are coming soon.
